--Universal Build Instructions--

1. Download Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/download/) and install it

2. Set a Window's path to Python's directory

3. Download PyInstaller (http://pyinstaller.org) and unzip it

4. Download StableMiner and unzip it

5. Drag 'StableMiner.py', the 'Dependencies' directory, and also 'design.ico' (inside Dependencies) inside the PyInstaller directory

6. Open up a command prompt window and 'cd' to PyInstaller's window

7. Type 'python pyinstaller.py --onefile --onedir --icon=design.ico StableMiner.py'

8. Copy the 'Dependencies' folder, then go to the 'StableMiner' directory, the 'dist', then paste the 'Dependencies' folder next to the new StableMiner software

9. You can now move the StableMiner software and the dependencies folder where-ever you want, as long as they are located in the same directory.
