3. Download PyInstaller (http://pyinstaller.org) and unzip it

4. Download EasyMiner and unzip it

5. Drag 'EasyMiner.py', the 'Dependencies' directory, and also 'design.ico' (inside Dependencies) inside the PyInstaller directory

6. Open up a command prompt window and 'cd' to PyInstaller's window

7. Type 'python pyinstaller.py --onefile --onedir --icon=design.ico easyminer.py'

8. Copy the 'Dependencies' folder, then go to the 'EasyMiner' directory, the 'dist', then paste the 'Dependencies' folder next to EasyMiner.exe
